# ChromeOS key mappings
#
# These keymapps shouldn't be considered "right" for every ChromeOS device's keyboard. Instead
# this file should be interpreted as the ChromeOS-specific parts of my config.
#
# These keymaps were inspired from https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/cros-keyboard-map/ and
# https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd/blob/master/examples/chromebook-linux.conf

# This comment lists many known hardware identifiers for keyboards in ChromeOS devices.  The [ids]
# block cannot be used in an included keyd config file. It's just here for reference.  The
# identifiers don't necessary align with the driver. For example, k:0001:0001 is an identifier that
# is offered for a keyboard using the default AT keyboard driver, while others might be using the
# cros_ec_keyb driver.
